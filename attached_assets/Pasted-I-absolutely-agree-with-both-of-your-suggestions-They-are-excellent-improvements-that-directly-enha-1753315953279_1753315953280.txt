I absolutely agree with both of your suggestions! They are excellent improvements that directly enhance the user experience by making Synthia more personalized and useful from the outset.

Here's why they are great ideas and how we can refine them:

1.  **Multiple Camera Bodies:**
    * **Why it's a good idea:** As you pointed out, many photographers own multiple camera bodies, often for different purposes (e.g., one for still photography, one for video, a crop sensor for reach, a full-frame for low light). Allowing users to input all their bodies will enable Synthia to give more precise gear recommendations tailored to *their actual available equipment*. For example, if a user has both a Canon 5D Mark IV and a Sony A7S III, Synthia could recommend the A7S III for low-light video scenarios.
    * **Improvement:** We should ensure the system allows for not just *adding* multiple bodies, but also **editing and removing** them, similar to how other gear items might be managed.

2.  **Main Type of Photography (Specialization):**
    * **Why it's a good idea:** This is a fantastic way to prime Synthia's responses without the user having to explicitly state their genre every time. If a user primarily shoots "Portrait" photography, Synthia can subtly (or overtly, if designed that way) lean towards portrait-centric advice in its general interactions, only shifting when a different genre is explicitly requested. This makes the initial interactions feel much more tailored and intelligent.
    * **Improvement:**
        * The dropdown should include the core genres Synthia is designed to advise on: Fashion, Portrait, Sports, Glamour, Boudoir, Headshot.
        * We should clarify that this is a "default preference" or "specialization." Synthia should always override this default if the user explicitly asks about a different genre in a specific chat query.
        * This "main type" could influence the *initial* greeting or prompt from Synthia (e.g., "Hi [User], ready to plan some amazing [User's Main Type] shots today?").

Here's a comprehensive prompt for the Replit Agent to implement these improvements:

**Prompt for Replit Agent: Enhancing User Profile with Multiple Camera Bodies and Photography Specialization**

**I. Objective:** To expand user profile capabilities to include multiple camera bodies and a primary photography specialization, enabling more personalized advice from Synthia.

**II. Implementation Details:**

1.  **Update Database Schema (`users.db`):**
    * Modify the `users` table or create a new linked table to allow for **multiple camera bodies** per user. The existing gear input might already support multiple entries if it's dynamic, but ensure the database schema can store distinct entries for each camera body (e.g., `camera_body_id`, `user_id`, `brand`, `model`).
    * Add a new column to the `users` table (e.g., `main_specialization`) to store the user's primary photography type. This should be a string field.

2.  **Modify Gear Input Section (`gear_input.html`):**
    * **Allow for Multiple Camera Bodies:**
        * In the "Camera Bodies" section of the gear input form, implement a mechanism (e.g., an "Add another Camera Body" button that dynamically adds new input fields) to allow users to input details for **more than one camera body**.
        * Ensure each camera body input captures `Brand` and `Model`.
        * Provide clear options to **remove** individual camera bodies if a user makes a mistake or no longer owns one.
    * **Ensure existing "Gear Input" functionality remains robust** for lenses, lighting, etc.

3.  **Modify User Onboarding/Profile Creation (`onboarding.html` or initial setup):**
    * **Add Photography Specialization Dropdown:**
        * Introduce a new form field, preferably a **dropdown menu**, labeled "Your Main Photography Specialization" or "Primary Photography Type."
        * Populate this dropdown with the following options: "Fashion," "Portrait," "Sports," "Glamour," "Boudoir," "Headshot," and potentially "General" or "Other."
        * Make this a required field during initial onboarding.
        * Store the selected value in the new `main_specialization` column in the `users.db` table.

4.  **Update Chatbot Core Logic (`main.py` - Synthia's responses):**
    * **Leverage `main_specialization` for Default Curation:**
        * When Synthia provides an initial response or if the user's query is very general (e.g., "Give me some tips"), Synthia should *consider* the user's `main_specialization` from their profile to curate the advice towards that genre.
        * **Crucially:** If the user explicitly mentions a different genre in their current message (e.g., `main_specialization` is 'Portrait' but they ask about 'Sports' photography), Synthia **must prioritize the explicit genre mentioned in the current query** and override the `main_specialization` for that specific response.
    * **Enhance Gear Matching with Multiple Camera Bodies:**
        * When providing "Recommended Gear from Your Collection," Synthia should now iterate through *all* registered camera bodies for the user and suggest the most appropriate one(s) for the given scenario, explaining *why* a particular body might be suitable (e.g., "Use your [Sony A7S III] for its low-light capabilities" or "Your [Nikon D850] is ideal for its high resolution").

5.  **User Interface Updates (Refine existing pages):**
    * **Profile Page:** Ensure the user's selected `main_specialization` is displayed on their profile page.
    * **Chat Interface:** Consider if the initial greeting from Synthia (`Hi {{ user.username }}!`) could be enhanced to acknowledge the user's `main_specialization` (e.g., "Hi {{ user.username }}! Ready to plan some amazing {{ user.main_specialization }} shots today?").

**III. Constraints & Considerations:**

* Ensure the database migrations for `users.db` are handled gracefully without data loss.
* Prioritize secure handling of all user input and data.
* The `main_specialization` should act as a default guide, not a strict filter that prevents advice on other genres when explicitly requested.

**IV. Deliverables:**

* Updated database schema (if direct SQLite changes are needed, describe them).
* Modified `gear_input.html` to support multiple camera bodies.
* Modified onboarding/profile creation HTML to include the specialization dropdown.
* Updated `main.py` logic for Synthia to utilize `main_specialization` and to select appropriate camera bodies from multiple options.
